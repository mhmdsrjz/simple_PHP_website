<ul>
<li>Home</li>

</ul><br>
Header and footer are in a seperate php files by their own names. they are included to each different page by the command:
<br><br>
<code> include 'PHP FILE ADDRESS';</code>
<br><br>
The main data are stored in txt files in data folder. there are 4 different txt files include related data to each page. when the user click on the page name from the top menu, we checked the selected item by GET and put the related data to the body section.<br>
Also the CSS file contains the style format of the page.
